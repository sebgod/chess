Mark a TODO item as done and update related documentation.

Usage: /tick-todo <search text>
Example: /tick-todo DrawEllipse
Example: /tick-todo castling support

Steps:
1. Search `TODO.md` for the item matching the given text
2. Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for the matched item
3. If the item has a brief description, optionally expand it with what was done
4. Check if the item is mentioned in `CLAUDE.md` and update if needed
   (e.g. architecture docs that reference the feature)
5. Check if there's a related `PLAN-*.md` file and mark the corresponding
   phase/step as done
6. Check memory files in the `.claude/` memory directory for related project
   entries that should be updated (e.g. move from "todo" to "done")
7. Show the user what was changed across all files

Do NOT commit - let the user review the changes first.

If the search text matches multiple items, show all matches and ask the user
to clarify which one.

The item to tick off is: $ARGUMENTS
